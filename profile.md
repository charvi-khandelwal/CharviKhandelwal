## Summary / About

I’m passionate about solving problems, uncovering insights, and driving impact. As a rising junior studying Economics and Astrophysics at UChicago, I combine mathematical reasoning with financial strategies to tackle challenges head-on.
From leading client-focused initiatives at Everview Consulting to analyzing financial structures at Dubai International Financial Center, I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments. Recognitions like the Dean’s List and global competition awards inspire me to keep pushing boundaries.
When I’m not diving into financial data or strategizing solutions, you’ll find me on the soccer field, exploring creative projects in poetry, or chasing adventures. Let’s connect and create something impactful together!
